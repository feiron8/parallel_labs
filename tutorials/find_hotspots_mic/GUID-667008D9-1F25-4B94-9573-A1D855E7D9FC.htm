    <p> Intel processor numbers are not a
      measure of performance. Processor numbers differentiate features within each
      processor family, not across different processor families. Go to:

    <p> Software and workloads used in
      performance tests may have been optimized for performance only on Intel
      microprocessors. Performance tests, such as SYSmark and MobileMark, are
      measured using specific computer systems, components, software, operations and
      functions. Any change to any of those factors may cause the results to vary.
      You should consult other information and performance tests to assist you in
      fully evaluating your contemplated purchases, including the performance of that
      product when combined with other products.
